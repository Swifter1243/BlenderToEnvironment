# BlenderToEnvironment
This script is janky as fuck. nyri0 is developing a way better version right now.

This script only works in BTS. It duplicates the pillars and rescales them based off of blender transform info from ScuffedWalls.
The transform info comes in the form of notes, since its way easier to use them when they scale from the center.
DONT set the default pillars to false. If you want to get rid of them, yeet them out of render distance.
This script doesnt work with animations because that requires extra work which I havent done yet and it will just add to the jank. So wait for nyri0's or adapt this one if you want that.

Guide on how to get everything working is in comments in the JS file.
